This open source Project is based on “TSUNAMI NUMERICAL SIMULATION with the staggered leap-frog scheme (Numerical code of TUNAMI-N1)” of Dr. Fumihiko Imamura, Prof. of Tsunami Engineering School of Civil Engineering, Asian Inst. Tech. and Disaster Control Research Center, Tohoku University prepared in June, 1995 for TIME project.

The TIME (Tsunami Inundation Modeling Exchange) started in 1991 as a joint effort  of IUGG and IOC/UNESCO during IDNDR. The Disaster Control Research Center (DCRC), Tohoku University, Japan has been acting as the center of TIME, to transfer numerical technique of tsunami simulation to the countries which suffered or will suffer tsunami hazards. Fifteen institutions of twelve countries obtained the computer programs and manuals developed and prepared by DCRC through mails or by training directly from DCRC.  Four institutions of four countries obtained the technique through Mr. Ortiz, one of the trainees of the TIME project.  As of 2003, the TUNAMI code was transferred to nineteen institutions of fifteen countries.

In 1997, the manual was published by UNESCO as IOC Manuals and Guides No.35 “IUGG/IOC TIME PROJECT: NUMERICAL METHOD OF TSUNAMI SIMULATION WITH THE LEAP-FROG SCHEME”.

The TUNAMI code consists of;

TUNAMI-N1 (Tohoku University’s Numerical Analysis Model for Investigation of Near-field tsunamis, No.1) (linear theory with constant grids),

TUNAMI-N2 (linear theory in deep sea, shallow-water theory in shallow sea and runup on land with constant grids),

TUNAMI-N3 (linear theory with varying grids),

TUNAMI-F1 (linear theory for propagation in the ocean in the spherical co-ordinates)  and

TUNAMI-F2 (linear theory for propagation in the ocean and coastal waters).
